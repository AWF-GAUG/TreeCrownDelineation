# Multi-Class Tree Crown Delineation

This project is aimed at performing multi-class tree crown delineation using various deep learning architectures. It supports a variety of network architectures and backbones, making it highly adaptable to different types of satellite imagery. The core functionality revolves around segmenting tree crowns into multiple classes based on the input satellite imagery data.


## Features
- Supports multiple architectures (Unet, DeepLabV3, etc.) and backbones (ResNet, DenseNet, EfficientNet, etc.).
- Configurable training and validation settings through YAML files.
- Utilizes PyTorch Lightning for efficient training with support for different accelerators and devices.
- Includes augmentation and preprocessing steps tailored for satellite imagery.
- Metrics calculation including IoU and F1 score for performance evaluation.


## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/AWF-GAUG/TreeCrownDelineation/multiclass
```

3. Install the required Python packages:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Usage

To start training the model, you need to run the run_main.py script with Python. Ensure that you have the correct environment set up and all dependencies installed.

```
python run_main.py
```

Make sure to update the `multicls_config.yaml` file according to your specific requirements before starting the training.

## Code Structure
- `multicls_config.yaml`: Contains configuration settings for training the model.
- `multicls_raster_script.py`: The main script for training and validation of the model. Includes data loading, model initialization, training, and validation logic.
- `run_main.py`: Utility script to run training sessions with different configurations iteratively.
- `temp_config.yaml`: An example of a configuration file generated by run_main.py for a training session.
